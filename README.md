## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repo-name
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be available in the `build` directory.

## Usage

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create a new folder inside `src/features` with your feature name.
2. Inside the feature folder, create a new slice using Redux Toolkit and a corresponding component.

### Defining Routes

All routes are defined in `src/routes/AppRouter.js`. Add new routes as needed to match the structure of your application.
